                            <h2>How to Run</h2>
                            <h3>Windows</h3>
                            <p>Ensure first that you have JRE 8 installed on your computer. To do this, open Command Prompt, and type <code>C:\path\to\java_home\bin\java -version</code>, or if the path to your JRE installation is already in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable, simply type <code>java -version</code>. If the first line of output says <code>java version "1.8.0_(build num)"</code>, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you will need to download and install JRE 8 on your computer; you can do so from <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">the official Java website</a>.</p>
                            
                            <p>Next, download the executable <code>.jar</code> file from <a href="https://github.com/kurushiidrive/javafx8-minesweeper_executable">this repository</a>. The <code>.jar</code> file contains the files needed to run the Minesweeper game on your JRE, but do not extract it. Once you have downloaded the <code>minesweeper.jar</code> file and placed it into your desired directory, <code>cd</code> into that directory and type <code>java -jar minesweeper.jar</code>. The Minesweeper game should launch in a separate window.</p>
                            
                            <p>Shown below is a screenshot example of a Command Prompt session I did to illustrate these instructions. Note that the path to my JRE installation directory is on my <code>PATH</code>, and that the <code>minesweeper.jar</code> file is located in the <code>C:\Users\kurus\Desktop\minesweeper</code> directory on my computer.</p>
                            
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/run.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                            
                            <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
                            <p>Work-in progress. See <a href="https://github.com/kurushiidrive/javafx8-minesweeper_executable">GitHub repo</a> for temporary information for Linux in general.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Mac</h3>
                            <p>While this should be able to run on Mac as is, using the <code>java -jar minesweeper.jar</code> command in Terminal in a similar manner as in Windows, I have not verified that it successfully runs on Mac. Feel free to email me (you can find my email <a href="index.html#three">here</a>) if you run into any issues.</p>

                            <h3><code>MSModel</code> interface</h3>
                            <p>The crux of the project was realizing a representation for the Minesweeper grid with which the player interacts. At the lowest level, I use an interface defined in <code>MSModel.java</code> as a basis for the functionalities I saw necessary to include in the grid representation. The methods specified in this interface needed to serve the purpose of acquiring global state information of the grid -- <i>dimensions, number of mines</i>, and the like; modifying that global state -- through methods such as <code>reveal</code>; and finally obtaining information on the state of individual tiles in the grid -- <code>isRevealed()</code>, <code>getNeighbouringMines()</code>, <code>isFlagged()</code>, etc. I could have also used an <code>abstract class</code> instead of a Java <code>interface</code>, but it was easier for me to think of the set of fundamental functionalities as simply methods.</p>
                            
                            <h3><code>MinesweeperModel</code> -- the heart of the project</h3>
                            <p>The file <code>MinesweeperModel.java</code> contains a class <code>MinesweeperModel</code> which implements the previously mentioned interface <code>MSModel</code>. As such, it is perhaps the most important class of the entire project. In order to represent in totality the <u>idea</u> of the Minesweeper grid <i><u>without actually specifying anything related to graphical output</u></i>, <code>MinesweeperModel</code> makes use of an inner class called <code>Cell</code>, which enumerates a set of constants for each cell type, as well as the possible states in which that cell can be. Upon construction of a <code>MinesweeperModel</code>, a two-dimensional array of <code>Cell</code> is initialized with all <code>BLANK</code> cells. Information such as the dimensions of the grid and the number of mines must be passed into the constructor, as I use this to eventually load the grid with mined and numbered cells.</p>
                            
                            <p>For actually making the grid based on the parameters <code>numRows</code>, <code>numCols</code>, and <code>numMines</code>, instead of using directly the <code>numMines</code> passed into the constructor, I use <i>mine density</i>. Making the grid this way provides a layer of protection against the user potentially providing a <code>numMines</code> that creates a difficult- or impossible-to-solve grid. If the user gives a <code>numMines</code> that would make the mine density higher than 90%, the mine density is trimmed to 90% forcibly. Outside of initially making the grid, mine density is not used, and <code>numMines</code> is used directly (according to its adjusted value from the mine density if applicable). The number of flags available is also set according to the adjusted <code>numMines</code>.</p>
                            
                            <p>The <code>make()</code> method accomplishes making the grid. Using the adjusted value for <code>numMines</code>, it sets randomly chosen <code>Cell</code>s to <code>MINE</code>s, if that cell isn't already a <code>MINE</code>. <code>make()</code> also takes into account passed in parameters corresponding to a grid location; using this passed-in grid location, <code>make()</code> will "reroll" a <code>Cell</code> at which a <code>MINE</code> is to be placed if the previously randomly chosen <code>Cell</code> happens to be that designated grid location. <i>In terms of performance, simply rerolling a grid location for a <code>MINE</code> to be placed is not a very robust way of making the Minesweeper grid, especially for higher-density grids. Later I will address this issue.</i> After having allocated <code>numMines</code> mines to the grid, the remaining <code>Cell</code>s will be appropriately assigned to a number-valued <code>Cell</code> or a <code>BLANK</code>, corresponding to how many <code>MINE</code>s neighbour that <code>Cell</code>. In fact, another one of the methods from the <code>MSModel</code> interface, <code>getNeighbouringMines()</code>, assists in dong this. Finally, all cells are assigned appropriate states using <code>setRevealed()</code>, <code>setFlagged()</code>, and <code>setQuestionMarked()</code> (all of which have <code>false</code> for each <code>Cell</code> to start out).</p>
                            
                            <p>Perhaps the last vital, non-trivial method in the <code>MinesweeperModel</code> class is the <code>reveal()</code> method. It recursively reveals the <code>Cell</code> at the passed-in grid location (by setting that <code>Cell</code>'s <i>revealed</i> state to <code>true</code>. The recursion works like this: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>if the location to reveal is out of bounds, then nothing happens.</li>
                                <li>otherwise, if the location to reveal is already revealed, then nothing happens.</li>
                                <li>otherwise:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>set the <code>Cell</code>'s reveal state at that location to <code>true</code></li>
                                    <li>if the <code>Cell</code> at that location is a <code>MINE</code>, inform the <code>MinesweeperModel</code> that the grid is in a <i>lose</i> state.</li>
                                    <li>if the <code>Cell</code> at that location is a <code>BLANK</code>, recursively call <code>reveal()</code> on all <code>Cell</code>s <u>immediately</u> neighbouring this <code>Cell</code>.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>And that's all! Recursion enables the <code>reveal()</code> method to have a relatively simple implementation. Note that <code>reveal()</code> had a condition for setting the game state of the <code>MinesweeperModel</code> to <i>lose</i>. There is also a method for checking if the grid is in a winning game state: <code>isGameWon()</code>. This method iterates through each <code>Cell</code> in the grid, and will return true <i>unless</i> there is a <code>MINE</code> <code>Cell</code> whose reveal state is <code>true</code> (which is a losing game state) <strong>OR</strong> there is still a non-<code>MINE</code> <code>Cell</code> whose reveal state is not yet <code>true</code>, which isn't a <i>losing</i> game state, but not quite a <i>winning</i> game state either. These are the kinds of things <code>MinesweeperModel</code> will keep track of.</p>
                            
                            <p>In short, <code>MinesweeperModel</code> is an implementation of an interface, free of any relation to a corresponding tangible (graphical, for example) representation of a Minesweeeper grid, containing information about each of its <code>Cell</code>s, as well as being capable of properly initializing, modifying, and reporting information about its own state. Combined with a separate module that provides user-level functionality that can interact with the <code>MinesweeperModel</code> as changes in the game occur, it is the foundation for a highly robust and cohesive, object-oriented-compliant system to run the game of Minesweeper.</p>
